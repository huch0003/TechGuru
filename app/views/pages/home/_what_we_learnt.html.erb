      <h3>What We Learned</h3>

      <blockquote>Sometimes even good ideas need to be <span class="underline">killed.</span></blockquote>

      <p>We did this many, many times over the course of this project. Sometimes we were just killing an idea, other times we were throwing out something we’d built.</p>
      <p>It takes a great deal of perspective and courage to kill something for the betterment of a product. Even before we came on, this product took on different forms multiple times. It can be frustrating at times, but in the end, if you don’t make difficult cuts the product becomes complex and lacks direction.</p>

      <blockquote>Working on a product at a <span class="underline">distance</span> is hard</blockquote>

      <p>We really struggled when we left to come home for a couple weeks away from the broader team. Even though we were connected digitally, nothing could replace the close proximity and face-to-face communication we had when we were in San Francisco. Our weeks in Toronto, were without exception, less productive than those in SF. We looked to technology to bridge the gap, using Google Hangouts, Campfire chats, Anybot and the usual means like emails and phone calls.</p>

      <p>Maybe we were doing it wrong, but I just can’t imagine working at a distance ever being nearly as good as work side-by-side—Especially when working on a version 1.</p>

      <blockquote><span class="underline">Using</span> the product</blockquote>

      <p>If you’re spending the bulk of your time looking at sketches or discussing static pages you’re making way too many assumptions. A great product or service works well, it doesn’t just look good. Many UX issues are invisible. They need to be used to be discovered. For this project, mandating usage through posting articles and issuing bugs helped ensure we were using the product.</p>

      <blockquote>Moving fast means you’re probably never satisfied</blockquote>

      <p>Medium evolved at such a pace that we had little time to take a step back to look at it holistically, or, dive deep and make it pixel-perfect. This isn’t always a bad thing. It just means you make tradeoffs to advance the product in more functional ways.</p>
